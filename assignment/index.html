  <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
  <p>Can I put a space between string variables in a new string variable without putting the space in the original variable?<br>e.g. let firstName = 'Cyril' vs 'Cyril ' or let lastName = 'Malle' vs ' Malle' so that let fullName = firstName + lastName has a space between the two variables within the variable</p>
